### Project Description
A completely useless Chrome extension that pops up every minute you browse, awarding you a ridiculous certificate for “wasting time productively.”
Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate an over-the-top PDF you’ll never actually need.
The more you procrastinate, the more meaningless awards you collect.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The internet is full of hardworking procrastinators who tirelessly open tabs, scroll endlessly, and master the art of doing absolutely nothing productive. Yet, despite their unwavering commitment to digital time-wasting, society has cruelly failed to provide them with any official recognition. This lack of validation for world-class procrastination has left countless browsers unappreciated, unawarded, and unfulfilled — a true crisis that nobody asked to fix.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a Chrome extension that pops up every single minute you spend browsing and proudly hands you a Certificate of Achievement in Advanced Procrastination. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript magic, it instantly generates a glorious PDF you can download, frame, or promptly delete. Now, every wasted minute is officially recognized, celebrated, and immortalized — because if you’re going to procrastinate, you might as well do it with style.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
Languages
HTML5: For the structure of the popup and certificate pages.
CSS3: For styling the extension's UI and the generated certificate.
JavaScript (ES6+): For the core extension logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

Frameworks
Bootstrap: Used for responsive design and pre-styled UI components.

Libraries
jsPDF: A client-side JavaScript library to generate the PDF certificates.
Particles.js: Used for creating dynamic particle animations on the UI.
APIs & Tools
Chrome Extension APIs: The foundation for managing alarms, storage, and popup behavior.
Visual Studio Code: The code editor used for development.
Git & GitHub: For version control and project hosting.

Implementation:
Installation
Follow these steps to install the extension:
Download & Unzip
Click the download button on the project website to get the .zip file, then unzip it to a permanent folder on your computer.
Open Extensions Page
Open a new tab in your Chrome browser and navigate to this URL: chrome://extensions
Enable Developer Mode
In the top-right corner of the extensions page, find and enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch.
Load Unpacked
The "Load unpacked" button will appear. Click it and select the entire unzipped folder you created in the first step. The extension is now installed!

Run
There are no commands to run! The extension starts working automatically as soon as it's installed.
Make sure the extension is enabled on your chrome://extensions page.
Simply browse the internet as you normally would.
The extension will keep track of your time and automatically pop up with your well-deserved certificate every minute. The only thing you need to "run" is your browser.
